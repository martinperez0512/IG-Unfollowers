# IG-Unfollowers

This program allows you to see who has unfollowed your instagram account. 

Below is a step-by-step to see who 

## Step 1

Access your Instagram information from your account

Below is the method I use (I login into Instagram on my laptop)

Instagram >> Settings and Activity >> Accounts Center >> Your Information and Permissions >> Download your information >> Some of your information >> Followers and Following >> Download to device

For the date range I use All Time and the format as JSON (I haven't had any issues with medium media quality).

## Step 2

You will get an email with the files (this can take some time but for me it hasn't been more than 1 hour)

Download the data from the email 

## Step 3

Once you have all of the files, run the script [here](https://github.com/martinperez0512/IG-Unfollowers/blob/main/unfollowers.py) with your followers and following JSON files that you've downloaded

## Step 4

After all that you should be able to see Instagram accounts that don't follow you back!
